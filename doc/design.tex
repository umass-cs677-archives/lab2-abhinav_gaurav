\section{TODO}
program design 
how it works
possible improvements and extensions
description of tests

\section{Design}
We are using Python 2.

\subsection{Multi Threaded Server}
This implements the multithreaing support for all APIs.
\subsection{Database}
We have implemented REST API for Database Server

\paragraph{Database Schema}
Since clients need to know the time when the score was last updated we 
decided to keep a json file as our database table. In order to get 
maximum throughput we save all the game scores in separate files and 
also the medal tally are in separate file for both the teams. Hence, 
unless there is a query for same game or same team tally the database
server would process them parallely in separate thereads and they 
require separate locks.

\subsection{Dispatcher}
Dispatcher has all the information about number of clients registered with each front-end server and it selects the front-end server which has minimum number of clients registered to it.

\subsection{Leader Election}
All the servers (front-end, database) have a thread running on them which implements the ring algorithm to elect leader. It happens every t seconds , specified in config file. A server would have to get the centralized lock implemented in dispatcher having a rest endpoint. After electing the leader it release the lock over the API.

\subsection{Clock Synchronization}
Clock Synchronization happens every Delta/(2*rho) seconds, specified in config file. It implements Berkley's Algorithm. The Master clock is the leader among the servers (front-end, database). As the leader is elected based on load, master is the most resourceful server.

\subsection{Total Ordering}
We implement the totally ordered multicasting. The test file confirms the order of elements that are popped from the queue are same for all the servers. Confirming that the order is same across servers.


\subsection{Front End Server}
The Front End Server 

\subsection{Combined Server}
This server is the culmination of all 5 servers: Multi Threaded Server, 
Front End Server, Leader Election, Clock Synchronization, Total Ordering.
Uses Multiple Inheritance to achieve this.

\subsection{Client}
We have designed the Client to do both forceful client-pull whenever required and periodic client-pull perpetually in the background.
